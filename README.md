# EERI 325 Practical - Frequency analysis and Manipulation of discrete signals
Convert a 1-d sound signal to its frequency domain and perform filtering of the signal  
The same must then be done for a greyscale image

# Requirements
## 1-D (audio wave)
- For a digitized input sound signal
- Display and play time-domain signal
- Discrete Fourier Transform
- Display frequency-domain signal(phase and amplitude spectrum)
- Lowpass Filter
- Highpass Filter
- Inverse Discrete Time Fourier Transform

## 2-D (greyscale image)
- Display Digital greyscale image
- Discrete Fourier Transform
- Display frequency-domain signal(phase and amplitude spectrum)
- Highpass Filter
- Inverse Discrete Time Fourier Transform
- Display frequency-domain signal(phase and amplitude spectrum)
